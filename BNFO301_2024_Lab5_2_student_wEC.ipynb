You can think of this as finding the most common base in a position within a multiple sequence alignment. Consensus sequences can be useful for identifying and visualizing motifs in a DNA or amino acid sequence. You have been provided a FASTA file of aligned sequences. The goal of this assignment is to write a python script to read in the sequences from the file and generate the consensus sequence\n",
