During the phylogenetics lecture, we discussed the use of differnt models to estimate the distance between two sequences.  We applied these models to calculate distances, when given a DNA alignment.  However, you would likely find that best fit model for regions within an alignment is not the best fit model for other regions.  In these cases we often calculate model parameters from the empirical data and use K-means clustering to group aligment columns that are the most similar.  In this problem set you will be asked to perform clustering of real data."
